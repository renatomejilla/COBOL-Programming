Integrating COBOL with SQLite on a Windows 10 standalone computer involves a few steps. You'll need a COBOL compiler and SQLite library that can be 
interfaced with COBOL. Here's a step-by-step guide along with a sample program:

Prerequisites
COBOL Compiler: Install a COBOL compiler like GnuCOBOL.
SQLite: Install SQLite and its ODBC driver.
ODBC: Configure the SQLite ODBC driver.

Configuration Steps
Install GnuCOBOL:

Download and install GnuCOBOL.
Install SQLite:

Download and install SQLite.
Install SQLite ODBC Driver:

Download the SQLite ODBC driver from here.
Follow the installation instructions to set up the driver.
Configure ODBC Data Source:

Open ODBC Data Source Administrator from the Control Panel.
Add a new DSN for SQLite, pointing to the database file (it will be created if it doesn't exist).

Sample COBOL Program
Here is a sample COBOL program that integrates with SQLite:

       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. SQLiteDemo.
       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
       CONFIGURATION SECTION.
       INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
       FILE-CONTROL.
       
       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  SQL-CA.
           05  SQLCODE        PIC S9(9) COMP-5.
           05  SQLERRM        PIC X(70).
       01  DB-CONNECTION     PIC X(100).
       01  DB-STATEMENT      PIC X(256).
       
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN-SECTION.
           DISPLAY "Connecting to SQLite Database".
           MOVE "DSN=SQLiteDSN" TO DB-CONNECTION.
           EXEC SQL CONNECT TO :DB-CONNECTION END-EXEC.
           IF SQLCODE NOT = 0
              DISPLAY "Error connecting to database: " SQLERRM
              STOP RUN
           END-IF.
           
           DISPLAY "Creating Employee Table if not exists".
           MOVE "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee (" 
                "emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, "
                "first_name TEXT NOT NULL, "
                "last_name TEXT NOT NULL, "
                "address TEXT NOT NULL);" 
                TO DB-STATEMENT.
           EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :DB-STATEMENT END-EXEC.
           IF SQLCODE NOT = 0
              DISPLAY "Error creating table: " SQLERRM
              STOP RUN
           END-IF.
           
           DISPLAY "Inserting Data into Employee Table".
           MOVE "INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, first_name, last_name, address) "
                "VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '123 Main St');"
                TO DB-STATEMENT.
           EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :DB-STATEMENT END-EXEC.
           IF SQLCODE NOT = 0
              DISPLAY "Error inserting data: " SQLERRM
              STOP RUN
           END-IF.
           
           DISPLAY "Data inserted successfully".
           
           DISPLAY "Disconnecting from Database".
           EXEC SQL DISCONNECT END-EXEC.
           IF SQLCODE NOT = 0
              DISPLAY "Error disconnecting: " SQLERRM
              STOP RUN
           END-IF.
           
           DISPLAY "Program finished successfully".
           STOP RUN.

Steps to Compile and Run

Compile the COBOL Program:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your COBOL program is saved.
3. Compile the program using GnuCOBOL:

	cobc -x -free SQLiteDemo.cbl -o SQLiteDemo

Run the COBOL Program:

Execute the compiled program:
SQLiteDemo

Notes:
Ensure that the ODBC driver is correctly configured and the DSN (SQLiteDSN in this case) matches the name used in your program.
Modify the SQL statements as needed for your specific database schema and requirements.

This program connects to an SQLite database, creates a table if it doesn't exist, inserts a sample employee record, and then disconnects 
from the database. 

Adjust the code to handle more complex scenarios and error handling as needed.
