PURPOSE

Before we can begin learning about files, JCL, USS, and more, we need to make sure you are equipped with the right tools 
to be successful. For this contest, you‚Äôll be communicating directly with a Logical Partition (LPAR) on one of those fancy 
z16 machines. In other words, you get a piece of a z16 all to yourself! We want you to be able to learn as much as you want 
to on this platform, and you deserve to play on a real system ‚úîÔ∏è

GET CONNECTED WITH VS CODE
--------------------------
We will be using VS Code, an extensible editor made by Microsoft, to communicate with the mainframe. However, you can use APIs, custom apps, and terminals as another option as well. The software is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The system requirements are listed here üëà

TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE
--------------------------
1. Get your login information

Don't lose this (you can come back to this challenge and grab your IBM Z username (IBM ZID) and password at any time)

IBM ZID: Z73336
IBM Z Password: YHG02LDY
You will use this in STEP 7 in the VSC1 challenge

2. VSC1 Challenge

The VSC1 Challenge is displayed below.

At any point during your learning experience, you can reference the downloadable PDF in the top right of the page.

In this challenge you will:

Download and install VS Code and node.js
Login with your IBM Z username and password (ZID & Z Password) to set up the system
Submit a file as your final "check"
To unlock the next challenge:

View the challenge PDF on the next page
Complete all the steps in the PDF
On VSCode, submit the required JCL with no errors
If you submitted the JCL on VSCode and did not receive an "error" message, press "Challenge Complete" on the next page. Do not press "Challenge Complete" until your JCL has submitted successfully on VSCode
Ready? Set? Let's go. üèÅ
