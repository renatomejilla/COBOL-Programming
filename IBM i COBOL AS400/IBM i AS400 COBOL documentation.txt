IBM i (AS/400) COBOL Beginner Documentation & Practice Guide

1. What is IBM i (AS/400)?
==========================
IBM i (formerly known as AS/400, iSeries, or System i) is an integrated operating system developed by IBM for midrange computing. It combines:

Operating System

Database (DB2/400)

Development tools

Security and Job Management

IBM i is widely used for business applications due to its stability, integrated database, and support for COBOL, RPG, SQL, CL, and other languages.


2. Library, File, and Member Concepts
=====================================
IBM i uses a unique structure to organize data:

Library: A container for objects (like folders)
Object: Can be a file, program, display file, etc.
Source File: A type of file used to store source code
Member: Individual source code module within a source file

Example Structure:

LIBRARY: MYLIB
|
|-- Source File: QCBLLESRC  (Holds COBOL source)
    |
    |-- Member: PROG1  (COBOL program code)


3. DB2/400 Database Basics
==========================
DB2/400 is the integrated relational database for IBM i.

Tables can be created via SQL or DDS (Data Description Specifications)

Accessible directly from COBOL with Embedded SQL

Data types: INT, CHAR, DECIMAL, DATE, etc.

Example SQL Table Creation:

CREATE TABLE MYLIB/EMPLOYEE (
  EMPID INT,
  NAME CHAR(20),
  DEPT CHAR(10)
);


4. Display Files (DSPF) Overview
================================
Display Files define interactive screens for COBOL or RPG programs.

Created using DDS source code

Stored in source files (e.g., QDDSSRC)

Compiled into display files for use in programs

DDS Example:

A R SCREEN1
A  10 5'Enter Name:'
A  10 20 NAME 20A B

In COBOL:

READ DISPLAY-FILE
WRITE DISPLAY-FILE


5. Compilation Commands
=======================
Two common COBOL compilation commands:

CRTBNDCBL: Creates a bound COBOL program with dynamic linking.

CRTBNDCBL PGM(MYLIB/PROG1) SRCFILE(MYLIB/QCBLLESRC)

CRTCBLPGM: Creates a standalone COBOL program.

CRTCBLPGM PGM(MYLIB/PROG2) SRCFILE(MYLIB/QCBLLESRC)

Use WRKMBRPDM to navigate and edit source members.


6. Interactive Jobs vs Batch Jobs
=================================
Interactive Job: Runs with user input via terminal (e.g., 5250 screen)
Batch Job: Runs in background, no user interaction, submitted with SBMJOB

Interactive jobs use Display Files and respond to real-time input.


7. Overview of Embedded SQL in COBOL
====================================
Embedded SQL allows COBOL to interact with DB2/400 directly.

Example:

EXEC SQL
  SELECT NAME, DEPT INTO :WS-NAME, :WS-DEPT
  FROM EMPLOYEE
  WHERE EMPID = :WS-EMPID
END-EXEC.

Host variables in COBOL hold data from SQL

Requires pre-compilation and proper compilation steps

Practice Tips

Create libraries with CRTLIB

Create source files with CRTSRCPF

Edit source members with WRKMBRPDM

Compile COBOL with CRTBNDCBL

Use STRSQL for practicing SQL

Create and test Display Files with DDS

Combine COBOL + SQL for database programs
